# Unfair Flips Simulator

This project reimplements the logic behind the Steam game *Unfair Flips* to allow exploring strategies and how often they win. It's a work in progress.

The game's singular mechanic is coin flip. You win by getting 10 heads in a row.
Each heads pays out a dollar amount that can be used to upgrade the coin for better odds, faster flipping,
higher rewards for successive heads-in-a-row. The game is fundamentally a game of chance - you might never win, or you could
win very, very quickly.
